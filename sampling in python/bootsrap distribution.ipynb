    "To make a sampling distribution, you start with the population and sample without replacement. To make a bootstrap distribution, you start with a sample and sample that with replacement. After that, the steps are the same: calculate the summary statistic that you are interested in on that sample/resample, then replicate the process many times. In each case, you can visualize the distribution with a histogram.\r\n",

    "Here, spotify_sample is a subset of the spotify_population dataset. To make it easier to see how resampling works, a row index column called 'index' has been added, and only the artist name, song name, and danceability columns have been included.\r\n",
